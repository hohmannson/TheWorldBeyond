# TheWorldBeyond


The World Beyond is a Kopernicus based Kerbal Space Program star system mod that currently adds over 100 celestial bodies into a cluster of 6 star systems while preserving the stock system. The World Beyond mod is modular, allowing you to choose which part of the mod you wish to install and play with.

# Installation

1. Download and install the latest version of [Koperincus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases). The Kopernicus version you install should match your KSP version.

2. Download and install the latest version of [Community Terrain Texture Pack](https://github.com/Galileo88/Community-Terrain-Texture-Pack/releases).

3. Download the latest version of [TWB_Core](https://github.com/manguything50/TheWorldBeyond/releases/latest), extract the downloaded zip file *(make sure to use Extract Here)* and copy the extracted TheWorldBeyond folder into your GameData folder.

4. Download the system packs you want to use, as listed in the latest release, and install them one by one by copying the extracted TheWorldBeyond folders into your GameData folder. They should automatically merge into the same folder, and after this step, there should only be one folder named TheWorldBeyond in your GameData.

5. Launch the game in 64 bit and verify your install.

## (Optional) Visuals Installation

Currently, if you want to see sun flares, auroras, clouds, ocean waves and atmospheric hazes on the celestial bodies, you will need to install the visual packs, all of which relies on two 3rd party visual mods: [EnviromentalVisualEnhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases) (EVE) and [scatterer](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases).

1. Download and install the latest versions of both EVE and scatterer.

2. Download the latest version of [TWB_Visuals_Core](https://github.com/TheProtagonists/manguything50/releases/latest), extract the downloaded zip file *(make sure to use Extract Here)* and copy the extracted TheWorldBeyond folder into your GameData folder.

3. Download the matching visuals packs for the system packs you have chosen, and once again, install them by copying the extracted TheWorldBeyond folders into your GameData folder. Again, they should also automatically merge into the same folder.

**You can also install the entirety of The World Beyond with the visuals included by downloading the latest TWB_Full after installing Kopernicus, CTTP, EVE and scatterer. If you do this, simply copy the extracted TheWorldBeyond folder into your GameData.**

***At least 16GB of RAM is recommended if you want to run the entirety of TWB with all of the visuals.***
